# Truffula Notes 
As part of Wave 0, please fill out notes for each of the below files!!!!!!!. They are in the order I recommend you go through them. A few bullet points for each file is enough. You don't need to have a perfect understanding of everything, but you should work to gain an idea of how the project is structured and what you'll need to implement. Note that there are programming techniques used here that we have not covered in class! You will need to do some light research around things like enums and and `java.io.File`!!!

PLEASE MAKE FREQUENT COMMITS AS YOU FILL OUT THIS FILE.

## App.java
This is supposed to implement different functions for the user to either show hidden files or show colored files. 
to implement these functions we need to use the path that will be used, then determining: to use color, not use color,
or show hidden files. We'll be using the TruffulaOptions object to accomplish this, create a new TruffulaPrinter then use the 
printTree method afterwards. 

## ConsoleColor.java
This is going to add color to the Enum(which are constant values ) using ANSI code.
